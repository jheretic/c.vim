This is a mirror of version 6.0 of c.vim, from
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=213

There is a mirror where you'd expect:
https://github.com/vim-scripts/c.vim

But it is not version 6.0...

I will kill this repo when the official github mirror is brought up to date
I prefer this to installing plugins independent of vundle
If you know a better way please point it out

To use

```vim
Bundle "git://github.com/blak3mill3r/c.vim.git"
```

and :BundleInstall
